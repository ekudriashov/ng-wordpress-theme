# ng-wordpress-theme

Theme for WordPress, powered by AngularJS and WP REST API v2

## Installation

Install as usual WP theme, TGM plugin activation included for needed plugins. Wiil add detailed instruction later, when theme becomes more useful.

## Some about

This is my attempt to try and understand whether it is possible to create a fully functional WP theme with WP REST API and AngularJS.

### What I mean when say 'fully functional':
* core WP functionality;
* menus;
* widgets;
* templates;
* custom post types;
* custom taxonomies;
* custom fields (will try implement it with ACF plugin);
* ...

### Why AngularJS?
Why not? For me there is pretty much reasons to do so.
